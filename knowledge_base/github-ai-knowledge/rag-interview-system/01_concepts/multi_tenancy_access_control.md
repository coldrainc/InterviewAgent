# Multi-Tenancy and Access Control: Who Can Retrieve What

> Retrieval is a read path into every document you've indexed — multi-tenant isolation and document-level ACLs decide whether that read path becomes a data breach.

---

## Why Access Control Is Harder in RAG Than in Search

A traditional database query touches rows the caller is explicitly authorized to read. A RAG query does something more dangerous: it takes *any* natural-language input and returns the semantically closest content from the *entire index* — then paraphrases it through an LLM. If the index contains documents the user shouldn't see, similarity search will happily surface them.

Two distinct problems get conflated in interviews. Keep them separate:

1. **Tenant isolation:** Customer A must never retrieve Customer B's documents. Coarse-grained, boundary is the tenant.
2. **Document-level access control:** Within one tenant, user Alice can see the HR folder and user Bob cannot. Fine-grained, boundary is the (user, document) pair, and it changes constantly.

```
                    ┌────────────────────────────────┐
                    │        The Two Boundaries      │
                    ├────────────────────────────────┤
  Tenant boundary   │ Tenant A  │  Tenant B          │  ← isolation model
  (coarse, stable)  │           │                    │     (Section below)
                    ├───────────┼────────────────────┤
  Document boundary │ Alice: HR docs, Eng docs       │  ← ACL propagation
  (fine, volatile)  │ Bob:   Eng docs only           │     (Section below)
                    └────────────────────────────────┘
```

Note this is a different threat than [prompt injection](prompt_injection_risks.md): injection manipulates the LLM via malicious *content*; access-control failure leaks *legitimate* content to the wrong principal. A system can be perfectly injection-hardened and still leak every salary spreadsheet to every employee.

## Tenant Isolation Models

Four models, in increasing order of isolation strength. (See [vector_databases.md](vector_databases.md) for which systems support namespaces/partitions natively.)

| Model | Isolation Strength | Cost | Operational Overhead | Noisy-Neighbor Risk | When to Use |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Shared index + metadata filter** (`tenant_id` field on every chunk) | Weakest — one missing filter clause leaks everything | Lowest (one index, shared resources) | Lowest (one thing to operate) | High (one tenant's traffic/corpus affects all) | Many small tenants (1000s+), low-sensitivity data, free tiers |
| **Namespace / partition per tenant** (Pinecone namespaces, Qdrant shard keys, Postgres schemas) | Medium — isolation enforced by the DB's routing layer, not your query code | Low–medium (shared cluster, per-tenant partitions) | Medium (partition lifecycle: create/delete on tenant onboard/offboard) | Medium (shared compute, separate data) | The default for most B2B SaaS |
| **Index / collection per tenant** | Strong — separate index structures, separate tuning possible | Medium–high (per-index memory floor; HNSW graphs don't share) | High (N indexes to monitor, upgrade, back up) | Low | Hundreds of tenants max; tenants with very different corpus sizes or recall needs |
| **Cluster / database per tenant** | Strongest — separate compute, storage, network, encryption keys, even region | Highest (per-tenant infra floor) | Highest (fleet management) | None | Regulated tenants (HIPAA, FedRAMP, data-residency), contractual single-tenancy |

### The Three Main Layouts

```
1. SHARED INDEX + FILTER          2. NAMESPACE PER TENANT          3. INDEX PER TENANT
┌─────────────────────────┐      ┌─────────────────────────┐      ┌──────────┐ ┌──────────┐
│       One Index         │      │       One Cluster       │      │ Index A  │ │ Index B  │
│  ┌───┐ ┌───┐ ┌───┐      │      │ ┌─────────┐ ┌─────────┐ │      │ ┌──────┐ │ │ ┌──────┐ │
│  │A:1│ │B:7│ │A:2│ ...  │      │ │ ns: A   │ │ ns: B   │ │      │ │HNSW A│ │ │ │HNSW B│ │
│  └───┘ └───┘ └───┘      │      │ │ ┌─┐┌─┐  │ │ ┌─┐┌─┐  │ │      │ └──────┘ │ │ └──────┘ │
│  vectors interleaved,   │      │ │ └─┘└─┘  │ │ └─┘└─┘  │ │      │ own      │ │ own      │
│  one HNSW graph         │      │ └─────────┘ └─────────┘ │      │ tuning,  │ │ tuning,  │
│                         │      │ separate graphs,        │      │ backups, │ │ backups, │
│  WHERE tenant_id = 'A'  │      │ shared compute          │      │ keys     │ │ keys     │
│  (enforced in YOUR code)│      │ (enforced by the DB)    │      │          │ │          │
└─────────────────────────┘      └─────────────────────────┘      └──────────┘ └──────────┘
  Leak = one bug away              Leak = DB routing bug             Leak = infra-level bug
```

**The interview-relevant distinction:** in model 1, isolation is a *convention your application must remember on every query path*. In models 2–4, isolation is *structural* — a query physically cannot traverse another tenant's graph. Structural isolation is what you want to claim in a security review.

**Hybrid pattern (common in practice):** namespace-per-tenant for the long tail of small tenants, dedicated index or cluster for the few large/regulated ones. Route at the API gateway based on a tenant tier flag.

## Document-Level ACL Propagation

Within a tenant, permissions live in the *source system* (SharePoint, Confluence, Google Drive, Jira). The index must reflect them.

### The Sync Pipeline

```
SharePoint / Confluence / Drive
    │
    ├──► Connector (crawl or change-feed/webhook)
    │     └──► For each document:
    │           ├─ content        → chunker → embedder
    │           └─ ACL            → resolve to principals
    │                                ├─ allowed_users:  ["alice@co.com"]
    │                                └─ allowed_groups: ["grp-hr", "grp-finance-leads"]
    │
    └──► Vector DB upsert: chunk + embedding + metadata
          {
            "tenant_id": "acme",
            "doc_id": "sp-4421",
            "allowed_users": ["alice@co.com"],
            "allowed_groups": ["grp-hr"]
          }
```

Every chunk inherits its parent document's ACL. At query time, retrieval filters to chunks where the requesting user (or one of their groups) appears in the allow lists.

### The Staleness Problem

ACLs are copied into the index, so they go stale the moment the source changes:

- HR revokes Bob's access to the compensation folder at 9:00.
- Your connector syncs hourly. Until ~10:00, the index still lists Bob.
- Bob queries "engineering salary bands" at 9:30 and gets the document.

This is the access-control flavor of the [stale index problem](../03_failure_modes/04-stale_index_problem.md) — and it's worse than stale *content*, because a stale permission is a live security hole, not just a wrong answer. Mitigations:

| Mitigation | Mechanism | Trade-off |
|---|---|---|
| Change-feed ACL sync | Subscribe to permission-change events (e.g., SharePoint change API, Drive activity feed); patch metadata only — no re-embed needed | Connector complexity; event feeds can drop/lag |
| Short sync interval for ACLs | Sync permissions every few minutes even if content syncs hourly | Source-system API rate limits |
| **Late-binding check** | After retrieval, verify the user can *still* open each source doc (live call to source API) before sending chunks to the LLM | +50–200ms per query; source API becomes a runtime dependency — but it's the only mitigation that closes the window to ~0 |
| Fail-closed deletes | On any doc-deleted or access-removed event, tombstone chunks immediately, reconcile later | Possible over-removal until reconciliation |

Senior answer: metadata filters as the cheap first gate, late-binding verification on the final top-k as the authoritative gate.

### Group Expansion: Where to Expand?

ACLs are usually granted to *groups*; queries come from *users*. Someone has to expand `alice → [grp-hr, grp-eng, grp-all-staff]` and groups can nest.

| Strategy | How | Pros | Cons |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Expand at query time** (recommended default) | Resolve the user's transitive group memberships from the IdP (cached ~5–15 min); filter chunks on `allowed_groups ∩ user_groups ≠ ∅` | Index stores compact group IDs; group membership changes propagate at cache-TTL speed without touching the index | Per-query IdP lookup (mitigate with cache); filter is an OR over possibly hundreds of groups |
| **Expand at index time** (flatten groups to users in chunk metadata) | Store `allowed_users: [every resolved member]` per chunk | Query filter is a single equality check — fast and simple | A single group-membership change forces metadata rewrites across *every* chunk that group touches; allow lists with 10K users bloat metadata; staleness window now applies to membership too |

Rule of thumb: **expand the user at query time, never flatten groups into the index.** Group membership changes far more often than document ACLs.

## Filter-at-Query vs. Filter-Post-Retrieval

This builds on the pre/post-filter strategies in [vector_databases.md](vector_databases.md#metadata-filtering-and-its-performance-cost) — but with ACLs, the choice has *security* consequences, not just recall consequences.

### Pre-Filtering (filter inside the ANN search)

The metadata predicate is evaluated *during* index traversal; non-matching vectors are never candidates.

- **Correctness:** strong — unauthorized chunks cannot appear in results.
- **The recall catch:** with HNSW, a highly selective filter (user can see 0.1% of the corpus) means most graph edges lead to non-matching nodes. Greedy traversal can get stranded in regions with no eligible vectors, degrading recall or latency. Engines handle this differently: some fall back to brute-force scan below a match-ratio threshold (correct but slower); ACORN-style traversal skips ineligible nodes while continuing through them.

### Post-Filtering (retrieve first, filter after)

Fetch top-k ignoring ACLs, then drop unauthorized chunks.

- **Recall:** search sees the full graph.
- **The under-fill problem:** if the user can access 1% of the corpus, top-10 may contain *zero* authorized chunks → empty answer.
- **The side channels:** even though the user never sees filtered content, post-filtering leaks signal — variable result *counts* and *latency* correlated with how much restricted content matched the query, and naive implementations that rerank or log before filtering. ("I asked about 'Project Falcon' and got 2 results instead of 10... so restricted Falcon docs exist.")

### Over-Fetching (the pragmatic middle)

Retrieve k′ = k × (expansion factor, e.g., 5–10×), post-filter, return top-k. Tunable, but for highly restricted users no finite k′ guarantees k results — and k′ scales your reranking cost.

| Strategy | Authorization Correctness | Recall | Latency | Side Channels |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Pre-filter (in-ANN) | Enforced at search layer | Can degrade on selective filters | Higher on selective filters (fallback scans) | Minimal |
| Post-filter | Enforced *only if every downstream consumer filters* | Full-graph recall | Fast search, may need retries | Count + timing leak |
| Over-fetch + filter | Same caveat as post-filter | Good for moderate selectivity | k′ × reranking cost | Reduced but present |

**Default answer for interviews: pre-filter on `tenant_id` (always) + ACL predicate, and let the engine's filtered-ANN implementation handle selectivity. Post-filtering as a *security boundary* is fragile because every new pipeline stage must re-remember to filter.**

### How Major Vector DBs Handle Filtered ANN

| System | Mechanism | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Pinecone | Metadata filtering applied during search within a namespace | Combine namespace (tenant) + metadata filter (ACL); single-stage filtered search, no manual over-fetch needed |
| Qdrant | Payload filtering with payload indexes; filterable HNSW | Builds extra graph links so filtered traversal stays connected; `group_id`-style payload + shard keys for tenancy |
| Weaviate | `where` filter with inverted index on properties; multi-tenancy feature gives one shard per tenant | Tenant shards are structural isolation; `where` handles document ACLs |
| pgvector | Plain SQL `WHERE` before/alongside the vector operator | Planner may or may not use the HNSW index with the filter — iterative scan modes exist; bonus: Postgres row-level security can enforce tenancy *below* application code |
| Milvus | Boolean expression filtering + partitions/partition keys | Partition key per tenant ≈ namespace model |

### Code: Query-Time ACL Filter

```python
def retrieve_with_acl(query: str, user: User, k: int = 5) -> list[Chunk]:
    """Tenant isolation + document ACL enforced inside the ANN search."""

    # 1. Group expansion at query time (cached, TTL ~10 min)
    groups = idp.get_transitive_groups(user.id)   # ["grp-eng", "grp-all-staff"]

    # 2. Pre-filter: tenant scope AND (user allowed OR any group allowed)
    acl_filter = {
        "must": [
            {"key": "tenant_id", "match": {"value": user.tenant_id}},
        ],
        "should": [  # at least one must hold
            {"key": "allowed_users",  "match": {"any": [user.email]}},
            {"key": "allowed_groups", "match": {"any": groups}},
        ],
    }

    results = vector_db.search(
        vector=embed(query),
        filter=acl_filter,        # evaluated DURING graph traversal
        limit=k,
    )

    # 3. Late-binding check on the final candidates (closes the staleness window)
    authorized = [r for r in results
                  if source_system.can_read(user, r.payload["doc_id"])]

    audit_log.record(user=user, query=query, filter=acl_filter,
                     returned=[r.payload["chunk_id"] for r in authorized])
    return authorized
```

The critical property: the filter is built from the *authenticated session*, never from request parameters. Letting the client pass its own filter string is the metadata-injection vector described in [prompt_injection_risks.md](prompt_injection_risks.md) (`namespace = "admin" OR 1=1`).

## Leakage Surfaces Beyond Retrieval

Filtering the search is necessary, not sufficient. Five surfaces interviews love to probe:

**1. The embeddings themselves.**
Embedding inversion attacks reconstruct close approximations of the original text from its vector (research has recovered the majority of input tokens from common embedding models). Consequence: a vector store containing embeddings of confidential documents *is* a confidential data store. It inherits the source's data classification — same encryption-at-rest, network isolation, and access policies. "It's just floats" is the wrong answer.

**2. Shared semantic caches.**
A semantic cache keyed only on query similarity will serve Tenant B a cached answer generated from Tenant A's documents. Cache keys must include `tenant_id` — and for document-level ACLs, either the user's permission set (hash of sorted group list) or per-user caching. A cache added later "for cost savings" that sits *in front of* the ACL filter is a classic regression.

**3. LLM provider logging and retention.**
Retrieved chunks leave your boundary when sent to a hosted LLM. If the provider logs prompts, restricted document content now lives in their logs. Enterprise agreements with zero-retention, regional endpoints, or self-hosted models are part of the access-control story, not a separate procurement detail.

**4. Citations and metadata.**
Even if chunk *content* is filtered, returning "3 additional results withheld" or citing the title "Q3 Layoff Plan — CONFIDENTIAL" of a doc the user can't open leaks existence and topic. Filter citations, counts, and "related documents" UI with the same predicate as content.

**5. Cross-tenant contamination via fine-tuning.**
Fine-tuning a model (embedder, reranker, or generator) on pooled multi-tenant data can memorize and regurgitate one tenant's text in another tenant's session. Either train per-tenant, train only on tenant-consented/synthetic data, or don't fine-tune on customer corpora at all.

```
Query ──► Retrieval ──► Rerank ──► Cache ──► LLM ──► Answer + Citations
            │              │          │        │          │
        [filter here]   leak if    leak if   leak via   leak via titles,
         is step 1,     reranker   key omits provider   counts, "see also"
         not the        sees un-   tenant/   logs
         whole job      filtered   ACL set
                        docs
```

---

## Audit and Compliance

Access control you can't *demonstrate* doesn't exist, as far as an auditor is concerned.

### What to Log Per Query

| Field | Why |
|---|---|
| User ID + tenant ID + session | Attribute every retrieval to a principal |
| Timestamp, query text (or hash, if queries themselves are sensitive) | Reconstruct the event |
| **Filter actually applied** (tenant + resolved groups + ACL predicate) | Prove the gate was in place for *this* query — the single most valuable field |
| Chunk IDs + doc IDs returned (pre- and post-late-binding check) | Determine blast radius when a permission bug is found: "who saw doc X between T1 and T2?" |
| Late-binding check outcomes (chunks dropped) | Measures your staleness window in production |
| Model + prompt version | Tie the generated answer to its inputs |

Logs must be append-only/tamper-evident, and note the recursion: the audit log now contains queries and doc IDs, so *it* needs access control and a retention policy too (typical: 1–7 years depending on regime — SOC 2, HIPAA, internal policy).

### Demonstrating to Auditors

- **Design evidence:** architecture doc showing structural tenant isolation + the single enforcement point for ACL filters (one choke-point function, not filters sprinkled across call sites).
- **Operating evidence:** sampled query logs showing filters applied; ACL sync lag dashboards (P95 time from source revocation → index update).
- **Negative testing:** automated cross-tenant probes in CI — synthetic Tenant A user issues queries engineered to be nearest-neighbors of Tenant B content and must get zero results. This is the access-control equivalent of a recall probe set.

## Interview Gotchas

### "Design RAG over SharePoint that respects permissions" — Canonical Outline

1. **Clarify:** one org or multi-tenant? How fresh must permissions be (minutes vs. seconds)? Scale of users/groups? (Maps onto the requirements step in [system_design_principles.md](../00_overview/system_design_principles.md).)
2. **Ingestion:** connector consumes SharePoint change feed → chunks + embeddings + per-chunk ACL metadata (site/library/item permissions resolved to users + groups).
3. **Identity:** user authenticates via the IdP (Entra ID); query-time transitive group expansion, cached with short TTL.
4. **Retrieval:** pre-filter inside ANN: `tenant + (user ∈ allowed_users OR groups ∩ allowed_groups)`.
5. **Staleness defense:** late-binding permission check against SharePoint on the final top-k before generation; fail-closed on connector gaps.
6. **Beyond retrieval:** ACL-aware citations, tenant+permission-set cache keys, zero-retention LLM endpoint.
7. **Audit:** per-query log of user, filter, chunk IDs; cross-tenant probe tests; sync-lag SLO.

Mentioning the **two-gate model** (cheap metadata pre-filter + authoritative late-binding check) and the **staleness window** is what separates a senior answer from "just add a metadata filter."

### The Classic Trap: Post-Filter Stages Reintroducing Filtered Docs

Any stage added *after* the ACL gate that has its own document access can leak:

- A **reranker** that re-queries the index "for more candidates" without the filter.
- A **semantic cache** that returns an answer generated under a *different* user's (broader) permissions.
- A **"related documents" / link-expansion** step that follows hyperlinks from authorized chunks into unauthorized docs.
- A **summarization memory** that condensed earlier (more privileged) sessions into reusable context.

The principle to state: **authorization must be enforced at the last point where document content enters the prompt, and every component between retrieval and generation must be ACL-aware or content-blind.**

### Other Gotchas Worth Pre-Loading

- "Why not just filter the LLM's output?" — Because the content already left the boundary (provider logs) and LLM-as-guard is bypassable; filter inputs, not outputs.
- "Highly selective filter killed recall — what happened?" — HNSW traversal stranded among ineligible nodes; answer: filterable-graph engines, brute-force fallback below a selectivity threshold, or per-tenant partitions so the filter is the partition.
- "Tenant offboarding?" — Structural models make deletion easy (drop namespace/index — a GDPR argument *for* them); shared-index models require delete-by-filter plus verification that vectors are gone from index *and* backups.

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Isolation should be structural, not conventional.** Namespace/partition per tenant is the default; shared-index-plus-filter means one forgotten `WHERE` clause is a breach.
2. **ACLs in the index are a cache of the source's permissions** — treat staleness as a security bug, and close the window with query-time late-binding checks on the final top-k.
3. **Expand groups at query time, not index time.** Membership churns faster than document ACLs; flattening users into chunk metadata creates massive rewrite storms.
4. **Pre-filter inside the ANN search** and know the recall caveat for selective filters; post-filtering as a security boundary is fragile and leaks via counts and timing.
5. **The vector store inherits the source data's classification** — embeddings are invertible, caches must be tenant- and permission-keyed, and citations leak too.
6. **Log the filter you applied, not just the query** — blast-radius analysis and auditor evidence both depend on it.
