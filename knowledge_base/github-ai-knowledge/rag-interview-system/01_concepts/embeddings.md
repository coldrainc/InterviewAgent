## What an Embedding Model Learns

An embedding model maps text → dense vectors such that semantically similar texts are geometrically close. This property enables retrieval by similarity.

### The Training Objective: Contrastive Loss

Embedding models learn via contrastive loss. For each query, the model is shown:
- A positive document (relevant)
- N negative documents (irrelevant)

The loss penalizes high similarity to negatives and rewards high similarity to positives.

```
Training Example:
  Query: "How do you make pasta?"
  Positive: "Boil water, add salt, then pasta..."   ← similarity should be high
  Negative: "The history of ancient Rome..."        ← similarity should be low
  Negative: "How to train a neural network..."      ← similarity should be low
  
  Embedding space (2D projection):
  
        pasta_doc
           •
          / \
         /   \
        /     \
    query •     • rome_doc
        \     /
         \   /
          \ /
           •
       ai_doc
  
  Loss penalizes: proximity to rome_doc, ai_doc
  Loss rewards: proximity to pasta_doc
```

### The Three Encoder Architectures

**Bi-Encoder (Most Common in RAG)**
- Encodes query and documents separately
- At retrieval time: embed query once, compare against pre-computed document vectors
- Fast: O(1) retrieval after O(corpus_size) pre-computation
- Trade-off: Cannot see both query and document simultaneously; less accurate but enables large-scale search
- Used by: OpenAI embeddings, BGE, E5, Cohere Embed

**Cross-Encoder**
- Encodes query and document together
- Output: single relevance score
- Cannot be used for first-stage retrieval (no pre-computed document vectors)
- Accurate: Sees both inputs simultaneously
- Role in RAG: Post-retrieval reranking (covered in `01_concepts/reranking.md`)

**Adapter (Hybrid)**
- Bi-encoder for retrieval, cross-encoder for reranking
- The standard production pattern (covered in `02_interview_bank/02-advanced-rag.md`)

## The Major Embedding Model Families

| Model | Dimensions | Context Window | License | MTEB Score | Best Use Case |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|---------|-----------|---------------|
| `text-embedding-3-small` | 512 | 8,192 | Proprietary | 62.3 | General-purpose (Recommended starting point) |
| `text-embedding-3-large` | 3,072 | 8,192 | Proprietary | 64.6 | High-precision retrieval; supports Matryoshka |
| `BGE-large-en-v1.5` | 1,024 | 512 | Apache 2.0 | 64.2 | Open-source alternative to OpenAI; good for English |
| `E5-mistral-7b-instruct` | 4,096 | 32,768 | MIT | 61.5 | Long-context support; multilingual |
| `Cohere Embed v3` | 1,024 | 512 | Proprietary | 63.9 | Built-in search_type parameter (separate embeddings for retrieval vs. search) |
| `nomic-embed-text` | 768 | 8,192 | CC-BY-SA | 62.4 | Open-source; competitive with OpenAI; uses Matryoshka |

### MTEB Benchmark Explained

MTEB (Massive Text Embedding Benchmark) evaluates embeddings on 56 datasets across 8 task types (retrieval, clustering, classification, etc.). A score of 60+ is production-grade.

**What MTEB tests well:** General-purpose retrieval on diverse text
**What MTEB misses:** Domain-specific performance (medical, legal, code)

### The Matryoshka Trick: Embedding Dimension Truncation

OpenAI's `text-embedding-3` models support Matryoshka embeddings. The key insight: you can truncate the embedding to fewer dimensions with minimal quality loss.

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

# Full 512-dim embedding via the dimensions parameter
response = client.embeddings.create(
    model="text-embedding-3-small",
    input="What is RAG?",
    dimensions=512
)
full_embedding = response.data[0].embedding  # length: 512

# Truncate to 256 dims — OpenAI handles this server-side
response_truncated = client.embeddings.create(
    model="text-embedding-3-small",
    input="What is RAG?",
    dimensions=256
)
truncated = response_truncated.data[0].embedding  # length: 256

# Saves 50% storage + 50% retrieval latency with ~1% recall loss
```

**When to use:** If your latency or storage budget is tight. Trade-off: ~1% recall loss per 50% dimension reduction.

## Similarity Metrics

All three metrics measure how close two vectors are. The choice matters for retrieval quality.

### Cosine Similarity

**Formula (plaintext):** similarity = (A · B) / (||A|| × ||B||)
- Normalizes by vector magnitude
- Range: [-1, 1], where 1 = identical direction, -1 = opposite
- Invariant to vector magnitude (doesn't care if vector is scaled)

**When to use:** Almost always. Default for embedding-based retrieval.

**When it fails:** Rarely. Vectors from the same embedding model are designed for cosine similarity.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

query_vec = np.array([1, 2, 3])
doc_vec = np.array([1, 2, 3.1])

sim = cosine_similarity([query_vec], [doc_vec])[0][0]
print(sim)  # Output: ~0.9998 (very close)
```

### Dot Product

**Formula:** similarity = A · B (no normalization)
- Sensitive to vector magnitude
- Range: [-∞, +∞]
- Faster to compute than cosine (no normalization step)

**When to use:** Only if the embedding model was explicitly trained with dot product (e.g., OpenAI `text-embedding-3-large` with "Matryoshka" training can use dot product).

**When it fails:** Most models are trained assuming normalized vectors (cosine). Using dot product on cosine-trained embeddings gives wrong results.

### Euclidean Distance

**Formula:** distance = √(Σ(A_i - B_i)²)
- Measures absolute distance in vector space
- Range: [0, ∞), where 0 = identical
- Sensitive to vector magnitude and dimensionality

**When to use:** Rarely in RAG. Some clustering algorithms use it.

**When it fails:** On high-dimensional sparse vectors; the curse of dimensionality makes Euclidean distance unreliable.

### Comparison Table

| Metric | Speed | Invariant to Scale? | Use in RAG? | Why / Why Not |
|--------|-------|-------------------|-----------|---------------|
| Cosine | Fast (normalized once, then dot product) | Yes | **Yes, default** | Designed for embedding vectors; scale-invariant |
| Dot Product | Fastest (just multiply) | No | Only if trained for it | Risky; requires model documentation |
| Euclidean | Moderate | No | No | Curse of dimensionality; unreliable in high dims |

### Code: Computing All Three

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity, euclidean_distances

query = np.array([0.5, 0.3, 0.8, 0.2])
doc1 = np.array([0.5, 0.3, 0.8, 0.2])  # Identical
doc2 = np.array([0.1, 0.9, 0.2, 0.4])  # Different

# Cosine
cosine_sim_1 = cosine_similarity([query], [doc1])[0][0]  # 1.0 (identical)
cosine_sim_2 = cosine_similarity([query], [doc2])[0][0]  # ~0.15 (different)

# Dot Product
dot_prod_1 = np.dot(query, doc1)  # 1.02
dot_prod_2 = np.dot(query, doc2)  # 0.51

# Euclidean
euclidean_1 = np.linalg.norm(query - doc1)  # ~0.0 (identical)
euclidean_2 = np.linalg.norm(query - doc2)  # ~0.87 (different)

# Key insight: cosine ranks identically (doc1 > doc2) despite different magnitudes
# Euclidean depends on vector magnitude; cosine does not
```

## Embedding Quality Problems

Five failure modes that manifest in production RAG systems, with diagnostic tests for each.

### 1. Domain Mismatch

**The problem:** Embedding model trained on general text performs poorly on domain-specific terminology.

**Example:** Medical embeddings
- Query: "What is myocardial infarction?"
- General embedding model confuses this with general words about "muscle" and "damage"
- Medical-trained embeddings understand cardiology-specific semantics

**Detection:** Run retrieval on 20 domain-specific queries with labeled relevant documents. Compare NDCG@5 for general model vs. domain model. Gap >0.1 signals domain mismatch.

**Fix:** Fine-tune embeddings on domain data (see "Fine-Tuning Embeddings" section below).

### 2. Long-Document Degradation

**The problem:** Most embedding models truncate input at 512–8192 tokens. Longer documents lose information.

**Example:** A 50-page PDF
- Model truncates at 512 tokens → only first ~2 pages are embedded
- Later relevant content is lost
- Query for content on page 40 won't retrieve the document

**Detection:** Plot retrieval recall vs. document length on your corpus. Recall should be constant; if it drops for long documents, you have degradation.

**Fix:** Use a longer-context embedding model (E5-mistral-7b: 32K tokens) or chunk documents aggressively (covered in `01_concepts/chunking_strategies.md`).

### 3. Language / Script Mismatch

**The problem:** Monolingual embeddings fail on non-English text.

**Example:** English embeddings on Chinese text
- English models see Chinese characters as atomic; no semantic relationship
- Retrieval fails even for semantically similar Chinese documents

**Detection:** Test on queries/documents in your target language(s). If NDCG drops >50% vs. English, you need multilingual embeddings.

**Fix:** Use multilingual embeddings (mBERT, XLM-RoBERTa, or multilingual versions of BGE/E5) trained on 50+ languages.

### 4. Antonym Collapse

**The problem:** Embeddings of opposite words can be very similar.

**Example:** "profit" and "loss"
- Both are financial terms; appear in similar contexts
- Embedding model assigns similar vectors
- Queries for "profit margins" might incorrectly retrieve "loss analysis"

**Detection:** Embed antonym pairs (profit/loss, hot/cold, increase/decrease). Compute cosine similarity. If >0.5, you have antonym collapse.

**Fix:** Use a reranker as post-processing (covered in `01_concepts/reranking.md`) to catch these reversals.

### 5. Semantic Drift Over Time

**The problem:** Corpus terminology evolves; embeddings don't.

**Example:** "COVID" and "pandemic"
- Pre-2020, these words were unrelated
- Post-2020, they're synonymous
- Old embeddings (pre-2020) don't reflect this change
- Retrieval quality degrades over time

**Detection:** Re-run NDCG on a fixed probe set monthly. If NDCG drops >5% without corpus changes, semantic drift is likely.

**Fix:** Re-index corpus periodically (quarterly or semi-annually) with the latest embedding model.

## Fine-Tuning Embeddings

When off-the-shelf embeddings don't work, fine-tune them on your domain.

> See [Fine-Tuning for RAG](./fine_tuning.md) for when and how to fine-tune embedding models and rerankers.

### Data Requirements

- **Minimum:** 1,000 (query, relevant_doc) pairs
- **Recommended:** 5,000+ pairs
- **Very effective:** 10,000+ pairs

### Mining Training Data

Use your existing systems to generate pairs:

```python
# From click logs
def mine_from_clicks(click_logs):
    pairs = []
    for user_id, query, clicked_docs in click_logs:
        if len(clicked_docs) > 0:
            # Positive: a document the user clicked
            positive_doc = clicked_docs[0]
            # Negatives: documents that appeared but weren't clicked
            negative_docs = [doc for doc in all_retrieved_docs if doc not in clicked_docs]
            pairs.append((query, positive_doc, negative_docs))
    return pairs

# From feedback
def mine_from_feedback(feedback_logs):
    pairs = []
    for query, doc, rating in feedback_logs:
        if rating >= 4:  # Thumbs up
            pairs.append((query, doc, positive=True))
        elif rating <= 2:  # Thumbs down
            pairs.append((query, doc, positive=False))
    return pairs
```

### Fine-Tuning with sentence-transformers

```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer, InputExample, losses
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader

# Load pre-trained model
model = SentenceTransformer('sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2')

# Prepare training data
train_examples = [
    InputExample(texts=["What is RAG?", "RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation..."], label=0.9),
    InputExample(texts=["What is RAG?", "The history of Ancient Rome"], label=0.1),
    # ... more examples
]

# Set up training
train_dataloader = DataLoader(train_examples, shuffle=True, batch_size=32)
train_loss = losses.MultipleNegativesRankingLoss(model)

# Fine-tune
model.fit(
    train_objectives=[(train_dataloader, train_loss)],
    epochs=3,
    warmup_steps=100,
)

model.save("./fine-tuned-embeddings")
```

### Evaluation Loop

```python
from sentence_transformers.util import pytorch_cos_sim

def evaluate_embeddings(model, test_queries, test_docs):
    """Compute NDCG@5 for evaluation set."""
    ndcg_scores = []
    
    for query, relevant_docs in test_queries:
        query_emb = model.encode(query, convert_to_tensor=True)
        doc_embs = model.encode(test_docs, convert_to_tensor=True)
        
        # Compute similarities
        similarities = pytorch_cos_sim(query_emb, doc_embs)[0]
        
        # Rank documents
        ranked = np.argsort(-similarities.cpu().numpy())
        
        # Compute NDCG@5
        ndcg = compute_ndcg(ranked[:5], relevant_docs)
        ndcg_scores.append(ndcg)
    
    return np.mean(ndcg_scores)

# Before fine-tuning
baseline_ndcg = evaluate_embeddings(model, test_queries, test_docs)  # e.g., 0.72

# After fine-tuning
finetuned_ndcg = evaluate_embeddings(model, test_queries, test_docs)  # e.g., 0.85

print(f"Improvement: {finetuned_ndcg - baseline_ndcg:.2%}")  # +13%
```

## Embeddings in the RAG Stack

How embedding model choice affects different RAG architectures.

| RAG Type | Embedding Requirement | Why | Recommendation |
|----------|----------------------|-----|-----------------|
| Naive RAG | Crucial; does 80% of work | Poor embeddings → poor retrieval | Use text-embedding-3-small minimum |
| Advanced RAG | Still crucial; reranker compensates for some embedding errors | Reranker catches embedding mistakes | Fine-tune if NDCG@5 <0.75 |
| Modular RAG | Depends on modules chosen | Sparsity module is embedding-agnostic | Start with text-embedding-3-small; specialize if needed |
| Adaptive RAG | Critical for routing decisions | Router classifier depends on embedding quality | Use robust, general embeddings (not domain-specific) |
| Agentic RAG | Crucial; agent relies on initial retrieval | Agent can't fix fundamental retrieval failures | Invest in good embeddings; agent won't save bad retrieval |
| Self-RAG | Critical; fine-tuning amplifies embedding quality | Feedback signal trains on top of embeddings | Use production-quality embeddings before fine-tuning |

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Cosine similarity is the default.** Use it unless the model documentation explicitly says otherwise.
2. **MTEB >60 is production-grade.** Don't use models below this threshold without domain-specific justification.
3. **Domain mismatch is the #1 cause of RAG failures.** Test your embeddings on domain-specific queries early.
4. **Fine-tuning requires 1K+ labeled pairs.** Start with zero-shot embeddings; only fine-tune if your NDCG@5 <0.75.
5. **Embedding quality cascades.** Poor embeddings can't be fixed by better rerankers or LLMs. Fix retrieval first.
